Main accomplishments:
-	Got watchdog working and able to watch a directory
-	Got the different classes talking to each other
-	Have a class to store the data (FileWarehouse is now called DataWarehouse)
-	DataWarehouse is storing data as intended with necessary fields
-	Watchdog is properly handing off “event” data to Datawarehouse
-	Have some code that creates a tkinter window
-	Some framework done but lots of ground to still cover

Hurdles:
-	Currently just getting the MVC working seems to be the major one, nothing significant just more time needed. We are able to complete this.
-	More of a personal thing but carving out time in the week has proven difficult, some nights is 3-4 hrs some nights its none. We are finding ways to make good progress though!

Help Needed:
-	Currently there are no major issues where we have found we need help. Just more time spent getting more things working!
